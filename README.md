# Nyumat's Showcase

## ⚡️ Welcome to my web 'Showcase' repository ⚡️

While I've had many sites over the years, this is my first time *actually* bringing all my skills together to show-off in a sense. I wanted to create a site that was both visually appealing and technically impressive. I'm very happy with the result so far, and I hope you are too!

## 🛠 Tech Stack 🛠

I had many iterations of this site, but I finally settled on a tech stack that I was happy with. I wanted to use the latest and greatest technologies, but also keep it simple and easy to maintain. I'm astonished that even while switching tech stacks nearly weekly, I was able to complete this site in 2 weeks.
