# ⚡️ Welcome to my ~~portfolio site~~ ⚡️

While I've had many sites over the past 3 years, this is my first time _actually_ bringing all my skills together to "show-off" in a sense. I update the content every couple months, so be sure to check back in!

## 🛠 Tech Stack 🛠

I had many iterations of this site, but I finally settled on a tech stack that I was happy with. I wanted to use the latest and greatest technologies, but also keep it simple and easy to maintain. I also wanted to use this project as a way to learn new technologies, so I tried to use as many "new" technologies as I could.
